    "Food is the cornerstone of our lives. Josh and I both grew up in families where most activities centered around the kitchen.The Foodie Family.I grew up in NY in a large, loud, happy, fighting Italian foodie family. Every Sunday was family dinner. Mama (grandma) came home from church and cooked �Gravy� (the NY Italian word for sauce), meatballs and ziti for hours. All of us kids watched and helped.Every holiday was huge in our world; we had 10 course meals that went on all day with long tables set up all through the house that fit every aunt, uncle and cousin you could imagine. There was wine, espresso, Sambucca, Anisette, an endless amount of food that had been prepared for the entire week prior to the event, a ton of fighting and an equal amount of loving. Nobody left mad and family always stuck together. And it all, always, revolved around food. Summers were spent gathered with family with endless barbeques and trays and trays of food- eggplant parm, meatballs, sausage, chicken cutlets, �gravy�, baked ziti, zucchini, salads, the best Italian cheese cake in the world and the list goes on and on. One of my first memories was going to our family friends' (which, if you are Italian, you know that close friends are just the same as family) restaurant, Caserellas, where the chef would let us in the kitchen and give all of us kids pizza dough to play with (this was before the days when it was normal for restaurants to do this).From Childhood Dream to a Life Career.I knew then from that young age that I wanted to be a chef. When I was old enough I got my first job in a restaurant. I tried my hand at being a server but my real love was always back of the house. .My very first job cooking in a restaurant was the pizza chef at an Italian restaurant that had a huge wood fired oven in the center of the restaurant, where all of the patrons could watch the pizziola (pizza chef) make the pies. I had no idea what I was doing at the time, but I wasn�t going to let that stop me. I was a teenager, hauling wheelbarrows full of logs inside and building a wood fire every day, making dough from scratch, balling it and making specialty pizzas to order during service.  Italy. My cooking career took many different roads throughout my time as a chef. I lived in Florence, Italy and was lucky enough to be able to study Italian food, art and cooking as well as travel around Europe sampling other cuisines. From there I attended The Culinary Institute of America and went on to work at many different restaurants in NY until I worked my way up to Executive chef. I branched off into catering and helped to run a few different large scale catering companies as the Executive Chef. But I always wanted something of my own. Something I could run for myself. And I always wanted to fall back on Italian food, on wood fired cooking, on dough, on the place were I planted my roots �Pizza!",

      "I'm always hesitant when my husband wants pizza. We have not found any pizza that I enjoy since moving to Florida. Well, stop the train! Corvo Bianco Wood Fired Pizza is amazing! I never eat pizza crust...I ate the crust! It's like there isn't a crust it's so flaky and airy! We tried three kinds, Squash with Caramelized Onions, Margherita and Prosciutto. The Squash was my favorite, the caramelized onions give it a bit of sweetness that I really enjoyed. My hubs, being a tomato pizza guy, loved the Margherita, the homemade mozzarella gives this pizza that extra special touch that you won't find in an average pizza place. Corvo Bianco, you have changed my mind! There is great pizza in Florida.",

    "Ready in 3 minutes or less! The Wood-fired oven is crazy-hot. Pies are done in about 3 minutes or less. Best enjoyed fresh from the oven or re-heated beforehand, if you're looking for that crispy goodness! Charred spots are good!   Due to the high heat, the crust will have dark spots - like a leopard :) This is not only normal but also desirable, as it adds to the flavor. 1 Pizza serves 1 Person. Smaller than the normal pizza, one pizza/person is the average portion... unless you have a gigantic appetite - in which case, get two :) Fold 2 Hold (and eat). Your call: fold the whole pizza to eat on the go like a savage, or sit down with cutlery like a civilized human. ONLY Premium Ingredients Fior di Latte Mozzarella made daily, authentic imported San Marzano Tomatoes, Caputo 00 Flour, Italian Sea Salt, Organic Fresh, Non-GMO Local ingredients ... A healthier Balance Zero sugar. Suitable even for gluten-sensitive people. A careful balance among crust, sauce, and cheese allows you to savor all 3 components.",

    'It is so much more than just a pizza. The flavor of the homemade sauce and mozzarella reminds me of being in Italy. Corvo Bianco nailed the dough, it is full of flavor and texture that keeps me going back for another slice!I would give Corvo Bianco a 10 out of 10 on being authentic. I look forward to going back and getting more pizza and seeing what else they can stir up in the kitchen because I will be in line for it!',
